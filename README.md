# smtp_send

This is a single PHP function to send mails (~90 LOC). The one function in
`smtp_send.php` is all you need. So you can just download that file and
`require` it or copy and paste the code to wherever you need it.

Feel free to open an issue if something doesn't work as expected. Sending a push
request is even better.

`smtp_send` sends mails directly via SMTP. It uses `STARTTLS` when the server
supports it. More examples are further down. Basic usage:

    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@dep1.example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@dep2.example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    Hello there. Just a small test. ðŸ˜Š
    End of message.
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@dep1.example.com', 'receiver@dep2.example.com', $message, 'mail.dep1.example.com', 587, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));


Signature and parameters
------------------------

~~~ php
bool smtp_send($from, $to, $message, $smtp_server, $smtp_port, $options = array())
~~~

__$from__: The mail address of the sender. This is given directly to the SMTP
  server and is independent of the `From` header in the message.
  
  If an addresses contains unquoted ">" characters the function aborts and
  returns `false`. Otherwise an address could be used ot inject further SMTP
  commands into the connection. A properly quoted address looks like this:
  `"foo\>bar"@example.com` (I know it looks strange but that's the RFC).

__$to__: The mail address of the receiver(s) given to the SMTP server. Again
  this is independent from the `To` header(s) in the message. If an array of
  mail addresses is given the mail is send to each address (one `RCPT TO`
  command is send for each address). Just like in `$from` ">" characters have
  to be quoted or the function returns `false`.
  
  You can send mails to many people without giving away everyones mail
  address (BCC, Blind Carbon Copy). For that set the `To` header _within_ the
  mail to something like "Undisclosed recipients:;" while listing all
  addresses in the `$to` parameter. Then the SMTP server will send the mail
  to everyone but the mail doesnâ€™t contain their addresses (example further
  down).

__$message__: The source code of the mail. You can find examples below or in
  [RFC5322 appendix A][1]. `\n` line breaks are automatically
  converted to `\r\n` (CRLF) so you can just use normal line breaks when
  constructing it.

[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#appendix-A

__$smtp_server__ and __$smtp_port__: The hostname (or IP address) and port of
  the SMTP server. Thatâ€™s the server you submit the mail to and itâ€™ll figure
  out how it gets there. The function will use [`fsockopen()`][2] to connect
  to that server and submit the mail via SMTP commands. Since `fsockopen()`
  supports [transports][3] you can use TLS or UNIX domain sockets for
  submission (again, see code examples further down).
  
  Example hostnames: `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `mail.example.com`,
  `tls://mail.example.com`
  
  Often used ports:
  
  - 587 (starts without encryption but usually secured with `STARTTLS`)
  - 465 (server expects connection to use the TLS transport)
  - 25 (usually for communication between mail servers)

[2]: http://php.net/fsockopen
[3]: http://php.net/transports

__$options__: An array with further arguments that are only needed for
  extended functionality like SMTP authentication or some down to the wire
  details.
  
  - `user` and `pass` keys: SMTP user name and password. Both have to be set
    to enable authentication. Right now only PLAIN and LOGIN authentication is
    supported.  
    Default when not specified: Don't do SMTP authentication.
  - `timeout`: The timeout in seconds used by `fsockopen()`. If it can't
    connect to the SMTP server in that time the function aborts.  
    Default when not specified: Return value of `ini_get("default_socket_timeout")`.
  - `client_domain`: The client identification send to the server with the
    `EHLO` greeting. Looks like servers ignore it. I donâ€™t know what they
    should do with it.  
    Default when not specified: Return value of `gethostname()`.
  - `ssl`: [SSL context options][ssl] used for STARTTLS. Especially helpful to
    disable peer verification (set `verify_peer` option to `false`) or specify
    a certificate.  
    Default when not specified: `[]` (no SSL context options).
  - `debug`: When set to `true` the functions echo()s all SMTP commands that are
    sent and all lines it received. Meant to debug unwilling SMTP servers.  
    BE AWARE: This might dump sensitive information like passwords to the output.  
    Default when not specified: `false` (no debug output).

Return value
------------

The function returns `true` if the mail was submitted, `false` if an error
occurred. No detailed error messages are supported but feel free to add it to
the code if needed.

Code examples
-------------

Sending a text mail via port 587 with SMTP authentication. `STARTTLS` is
automatically used when the server supports it. Otherwise the connection will
be unencrypted.

    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    Hello there. Just a small test. ðŸ˜Š
    End of message.
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', 'receiver@example.com', $message, 'mail.example.com', 587, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));

* * *

Use the `ssl` option to disable SSL peer verification (`verify_peer` SSL context
option). The `ssl` option can contain any [ssl context option](http://php.net/context.ssl)
(e.g. to specify a CA to verify against). The options are only used when STARTTLS
is used.

    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    Hello there. Just a small test. ðŸ˜Š
    End of message.
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', 'receiver@example.com', $message, 'tls://mail.example.com', 465, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret',
        'ssl' => [ 'verify_peer' => false ]
    ));

* * *

Sending a text mail via port 465. The server expects an encrypted connection
so we have to use the TLS transport (notice the `tls://` at the start of the
hostname).

    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    Hello there. Just a small test. ðŸ˜Š
    End of message.
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', 'receiver@example.com', $message, 'tls://mail.example.com', 465, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));

* * *

Sending a mail to many recipients without giving away their addresses to
everyone (BCC, Blind Carbon Copy):

    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: Undisclosed recipients:;
    Subject: SMTP BCC Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    Try to figure out who else got this messageâ€¦
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', [
        'smith@example.com', 'jones@example.com', 'taylor@example.com'
    ], $message, 'mail.example.com', 587, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));

* * *

Sending an HTML mail:

    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    
    <html>
    <head><title>An HTML mail</title></head>
    <body>
        <h1>See, HTML!</h1>
        <p>Have fun ðŸ˜Š</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', 'receiver@example.com', $message, 'mail.example.com', 587, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));

* * *

Sending a mail with an attachment ("mixed content"):

    $base64_file_data = chunk_split(base64_encode(file_get_contents("file.xyz")));
    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Attachment Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="XXXXXXXXXX"
    
    This is the preamble. It's ignored.
    --XXXXXXXXXX
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    This is a mail with an attachment. Have fun with it.
    --XXXXXXXXXX
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="file.xyz"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="file.xyz"
    
    $base64_file_data
    --XXXXXXXXXX--
    This is the epilogue. It's also ignored.
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', 'receiver@example.com', $message, 'mail.example.com', 587, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));

Based on the example in [RFC 2046 page 21][4]. The line "--XXXXXXXXXX" is the
boundary between the different parts and must not occur in any of them.
"--XXXXXXXXXX--" (note "--" at the end) signals the end of the last part.
Everything after that is ignored. Usually the boundary is a random
alphanumeric string with 20 to 30 characters. I just chose "XXXXXXXXXX" for
better visibility.

[4]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#page-21

Some mail clients use the filename in Content-Type name, some the one in
Content-Disposition filename. So set both.

Please set the Content-Type of the attachment to a proper value (e.g.
"image/jpeg" for *.jpg files). This helps mail clients to select a proper
program for opening the attachment. "application/octet-stream" is the MIME
type for a binary file with unknown content.

You can also use "Content-Disposition: inline" instead of attachment. In that
case the browser tries to show the attachment as part of the message. This is
often used for images.

* * *

Sending a mail with the same content as text and HTML (alternate content):

    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Alternate Content Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="XXXXXXXXXX"
    
    This is the preamble. It's ignored.
    --XXXXXXXXXX
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    A message with a list:
    
    - Point A
    - Point B
    - Point C
    
    --XXXXXXXXXX
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    
    <html>
    <head><title>SMTP Alternate Content Test</title></head>
    <body>
        <p>A message with a list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Point A</li>
            <li>Point B</li>
            <li>Point C</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
    </html>
    --XXXXXXXXXX--
    This is the epilogue. It's also ignored.
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', 'receiver@example.com', $message, 'mail.example.com', 587, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));

* * *

You can also nest mixed and alternative content. For example to send a
message with an attachment where the text part is provided as plain text and
HTML.

    $base64_file_data = chunk_split(base64_encode(file_get_contents("file.xyz")));
    $message = <<<EOD
    From: "Mr. Sender" <sender@example.com>
    To: "Mr. Receiver" <receiver@example.com>
    Subject: SMTP Alternate and Mixed Content Test
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:01:07 +0200
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="XXXXXXXXXX"
    
    --XXXXXXXXXX
    Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="YYYYYYYYYY"
    
    --YYYYYYYYYY
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    
    A message with a list:
    
    - Point A
    - Point B
    - Point C
    
    --YYYYYYYYYY
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    
    <html>
    <head><title>SMTP Alternate and Mixed Content Test</title></head>
    <body>
        <p>A message with a list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Point A</li>
            <li>Point B</li>
            <li>Point C</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
    </html>
    --YYYYYYYYYY--
    --XXXXXXXXXX
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="file.xyz"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="file.xyz"
    
    $base64_file_data
    --XXXXXXXXXX--
    EOD;
    smtp_send('sender@example.com', 'receiver@example.com', $message, 'mail.example.com', 587, array(
        'user' => 'sender',
        'pass' => 'secret'
    ));

  Added code to reject mail addresses that could potentially inject other
  SMTP commands.

- 2018-03-12 by Stephan Soller <stephan.soller@helionweb.de>  
  Multiple greeting lines from the server were not correctly consumed. This
  prevented mail submission on some SMTP servers.

- 2014-09-14  by Stephan Soller <stephan.soller@helionweb.de>  
  Wrote function to be independent of PHPs mail configuration.
